    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="understanding"><b>Understanding How The Product Works</b></span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sensors and Measurements:</strong> BreathSmart uses advanced sensors such as the DHT22 for temperature and humidity, CCS811 for CO2 levels, and a specific electrochemical sensor for monitoring carbon monoxide (CO). These sensors are chosen for their accuracy, reliability, and response times.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> The Arduino Nano 33 IoT, equipped with built-in Wi-Fi, collects data from the sensors using digital communication protocols like I2C and SPI. Each sensors data is periodically sampled to provide an accurate representation of the environment's air quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Data from the Arduino is sent in real-time to an MQTT broker using the MQTT protocol. This protocol is chosen for its lightweight nature and its ability to provide reliable and efficient message delivery even in environments where network bandwidth is constrained.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Processing and Storage:</strong> Once the data is published to the MQTT broker, it is subsequently subscribed to by Telegraf, which acts as an intermediary to parse and store this data into InfluxDB, a time-series database optimized for handling massive amounts of timestamped data.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-time Data Visualization:</strong> Live data streaming is handled through a web interface that connects directly to the MQTT broker. Using modern web technologies such as JavaScript and WebSockets, the interface displays the data as it is received, enabling users to see real-time updates without needing to refresh the page.</li>
      <li><strong>Historical Data Analysis:</strong> Grafana is used to fetch historical data from InfluxDB, allowing users to visualize trends and patterns over time through a series of customizable dashboards. These visualizations help in making data-driven decisions and understanding long-term air quality trends.</li>
      <li><strong>System Scalability and Fault Tolerance:</strong> The architecture is designed to be scalable, supporting the addition of more sensors or integration into larger monitoring networks. Fault tolerance is achieved through rigorous testing of the system under various scenarios to ensure reliability in diverse conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental and User Interaction:</strong> The system is capable of responding to changes in environmental conditions by adjusting the frequency of readings or triggering alerts based on predefined thresholds, which can be customized according to user preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="faq"><b>FAQ's</b></span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What air quality parameters does BreathSmart monitor?</strong> BreathSmart measures temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) using high-quality sensors to provide an accurate assessment of air quality.</li>
      <li><strong>How does BreathSmart send data in real-time?</strong> The system uses the MQTT protocol to send data from the Arduino Nano 33 IoT to an MQTT broker. This protocol is chosen for its efficiency and reliability in low-bandwidth environments.</li>
      <li><strong>Can I access historical data?</strong> Yes, historical data is accessible through the Grafana interface, which pulls data from InfluxDB. Grafana provides detailed visualizations of past air quality measurements.</li>
      <li><strong>Is the system difficult to set up?</strong> BreathSmart is designed for easy setup. Detailed setup instructions are provided in the user manual, which includes step-by-step guides on connecting sensors and configuring the software.</li>
      <li><strong>What should I do if my device stops sending data?</strong> Refer to the troubleshooting section below for common issues and solutions. Ensure that your device is connected to the internet and check the power supply.</li>
      <li><strong>How often are the sensors calibrated?</strong> We recommend calibrating sensors once every six months to maintain accuracy. Calibration procedures are outlined in the user manual.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="troubleshooting"><b>Troubleshooting</b></span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Problem: Device not connecting to Wi-Fi.</strong> Solution: Ensure that your network settings are correctly configured and that your Wi-Fi network is operational. Restart the Arduino and try connecting again.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem: Data not appearing on the live data webpage.</strong> Solution: Check if the MQTT broker is online and functioning. Ensure that the web client is subscribed to the correct topic and that there are no network firewalls blocking the connection.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem: Sensors not reporting data.</strong> Solution: Verify that the sensors are correctly connected to the Arduino. Check for any visible damage to the sensors or wires. Replace the sensors if necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem: Historical data not loading in Grafana.</strong> Solution: Ensure that InfluxDB is running and that Grafana is configured with the correct database credentials. Check the network connection between Grafana and InfluxDB.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem: Alerts not triggering.</strong> Solution: Confirm that the alert thresholds are correctly set in the system settings. Check the system logs for any error messages that could indicate why alerts are not functioning.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem: System reports frequent disconnections.</strong> Solution: This may be due to network instability or power interruptions. Ensure a stable power supply and consider using a UPS for continuous operation. Check the quality of your Wi-Fi signal and move the device closer to the router if necessary.</li>
